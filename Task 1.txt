You are working as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
You work within a larger team, where each member has a different role and 
level of responsibility.
Your team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz.
You’re hoping for a promotion at work, and this is an exciting opportunity 
for you to showcase your data analysis and visualization skills.



A data analyst sits between the business and the data.

What do we mean by that?

The Business refers to the client and your internal team members who won’t be 
involved in detailed data analysis.
They rely on your analysis to make strategic business decisions.
Importantly, not everyone will have a strong understanding of data. Your job 
is to communicate your data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.
 
The Data refers to the relevant data sources that you will clean, process, and use 
to generate interesting insights for the business.



Big Data refers to large, diverse sets of information that 
grow at ever-increasing rates. It includes the volume of information, 
the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope 
of the data points being covered (known as the "three v's" of big data)

An IPO stands for Initial Public Offering - 
this happens when a private company becomes public by selling its shares on a 
stock exchange.
