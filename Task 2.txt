You’ve identified Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types as our relevant data sets.

To clarify why you made this selection:

The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see 
“An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the 
largest popularity”.
As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the 
“Score” given to each reaction type.
We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, 
reaction type, and reaction score.
So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories 
have the largest score.



Second: Clean the data by:

removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re 
investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be 
worth including it.
